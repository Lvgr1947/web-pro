Project description steps

Search:
Create an html page with search bar and logout button: index.html
Search bar has a dropdown menu containing, isbn, bname and author as an option.
According to the option selected by the user, we will search the respective column in the database.
If any match is found, then we retrieve the whole row and display it with the isbn as a hyperlink that leads to its respective page.

Book page:
When a user clicks on any book, it's page will be open.
In this page, we will display the book details and all the reviews.
We first retrieve the isbn number from the parameter passed to the URL.
We will retrieve the whole row data from the rating table using the isbn.
The book page displays the details as a table with retrieved data.

Review submission:
If the user tries the “Write Review” option on the bookpage, check if the user reviewed the particular book earlier or not.
If the user didn’t submit any review, allow the user to write text, ask the user to rate the book(1-5) and then to submit the review.
Add the review to the rating table where ratings and reviews of that particular book can be stored.
Else, display a message saying “You’ve already submitted your Review for this book”
